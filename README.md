Differential growth is a generative algorithm inspired by the growth occurring in living organisms such as lichens, algae, poriferae, corals and other kinds of organic forms.

## Installation

1. Download a zip file from [Releases](https://github.com/inca/blender-differential-growth/releases/latest)
2. Install the addon in Blender by going to Edit > Preferences > Addons > Install

### Important notes

- The algorithm is "destructive" (i.e. it will modify the mesh in-place). It is recommended to set the Undo Steps to maximum (Preferences > System > Undo Steps) to be able to revert to previous results.

- Some combination of parameters may result in [combinatorial explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion) causing Blender to hang. It is recommended to save often.

## Development

It can be painful to develop in Blender's text editor.

One good solution is to symlink the repo to the Blender's addon location, then develop using your favorite editor.

Then use F3 -> Reload Scripts every time the change is made.

### Mac/Linux

Locate the addons directory, then replace `ADDONS_DIR` in `symlink.sh` and run it.

### Windows

Run `cmd.exe` as Administrator (Start menu, search 'cmd', right click).

Then run (correct the paths as necessary):

```
mklink /D "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Blender\2.93\scripts\addons\diffgrow" "C:\Users\boris\3d\blender\diffgrowth"
```
